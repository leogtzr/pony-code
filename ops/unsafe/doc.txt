Here is a list with all unsafe operations defined on Integers:

Operator	Method	Undefined in case of
+~	add_unsafe()	Overflow E.g. I32.max_value() +~ I32(1)
-~	sub_unsafe()	Overflow
*~	mul_unsafe()	Overflow.
/~	div_unsafe()	Division by zero and overflow. E.g. I32.min_value() / I32(-1)
%~	rem_unsafe()	Division by zero and overflow.
%%~	mod_unsafe()	Division by zero and overflow.
-~	neg_unsafe()	Overflow. E.g. -~I32.max_value()
>>~	shr_unsafe()	If non-zero bits are shifted out. E.g. I32(1) >>~ U32(2)
<<~	shl_unsafe()	If bits differing from the final sign bit are shifted out.
